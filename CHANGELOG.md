## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

#### Database Migration Required
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This update includes breaking changes to the database schema.

1. **User Collection Changes**:
   - `gorvenmentId` field renamed to `governmentId`
   - `password` field removed (security improvement)
   - `createdAt` field added

2. **Security Info Collection Changes**:
   - `safe` field replaced with `safeHash`
   - `alert` field replaced with `alertHash`
   - `salt` field added
   - All existing PINs need to be reset by users

3. **Device Collection Changes**:
   - `confirmed` field now properly stored as boolean
   - `type` field added to device mapping
   - `createdAt` field added

#### Code Changes Required

1. **Update all references to `gorvenmentId`**:
   ```dart
   // Old
   user.gorvenmentId
   
   // New
   user.governmentId
   ```

2. **Update PIN setup**:
   ```dart
   // Old - direct PIN storage (insecure)
   // This is no longer supported
   
   // New - secure PIN setup
   await auth.setupSecurityPins(safePin, alertPin);
   ```

3. **Update authentication calls**:
   ```dart
   // Enhanced with validation and rate limiting
   bool success = await auth.signInWithEmail(email, password);
   ```

#### Firestore Security Rules Update

Update your Firestore security rules to match the new schema:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /devices/{deviceId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId || 
         request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.ownerId);
    }
    
    match /security_info/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Required Actions After Update

1. **User Communication**: Notify all users that they need to:
   - Reset their security PINs (old PINs are no longer valid)
   - Set up emergency contacts in app settings

2. **Database Cleanup**: 
   - Remove password fields from existing user documents
   - Migrate governmentId field names
   - Archive old security_info documents

3. **Configuration**:
   - Update Firebase security rules
   - Configure emergency contact settings
   - Review and update privacy policies
