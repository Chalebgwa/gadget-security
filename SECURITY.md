# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Gadget Security application to protect user data and ensure safe device trading.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Security

#### Password Security
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 with unique salts (never stored in plaintext)
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 login attempts per 15-minute window to prevent brute force attacks
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after repeated failed attempts

#### PIN Security
- **Dual PIN System**: 
  - Safe PIN: For normal device access
  - Alert PIN: Triggers emergency alert while appearing normal
- **Secure Hashing**: PINs are hashed with unique salts using SHA-256
- **No Plaintext Storage**: PINs are never stored in readable format

### Data Protection

#### Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- **Format Validation**: Email, phone, government ID formats are strictly validated
- **Length Limits**: Appropriate limits on all input fields

#### Sensitive Data Handling
- **Government ID**: Validated format but stored securely
- **Phone Numbers**: International format validation
- **Personal Information**: Minimized collection and secure storage

### Communication Security

#### Firebase Integration
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth handles secure user authentication
- **Database Rules**: Strict Firestore security rules limit data access
- **Encrypted Transit**: All communication uses HTTPS/TLS

#### Emergency Alerts
- **SMS Security**: Emergency contacts configurable by user
- **Alert Masking**: Alert PIN appears normal to prevent detection

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigated by strong authentication and rate limiting
2. **Data Breaches**: Mitigated by data encryption and minimal storage
3. **Social Engineering**: Mitigated by user education and dual PIN system
4. **Device Theft**: Mitigated by emergency alert system
5. **Account Takeover**: Mitigated by strong passwords and monitoring

### Security Controls

#### Preventive Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Strong password requirements
- Rate limiting and account lockout
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

#### Detective Controls
- Login attempt monitoring
- Unusual activity detection
- Emergency alert triggering

#### Corrective Controls
- Account recovery mechanisms
- Emergency contact notifications
- Device ownership transfer logs

## Implementation Details

### Security Utilities (`lib/util/security_utils.dart`)

#### Key Functions
```dart
// Password hashing with salt
String hashPassword(String password, String salt)

// Input sanitization
String sanitizeInput(String input)

// Rate limiting check
bool isRateLimited(String identifier)

// Strong password validation
bool isStrongPassword(String password)
```

### Authentication Provider (`lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`)

#### Security Features
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Secure PIN setup and verification
- Input validation for all operations
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## Configuration

### Firebase Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Devices - read by all authenticated users, write only by owner
    match /devices/{deviceId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId || 
         request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.ownerId);
    }
    
    // Security info - only accessible by the user
    match /security_info/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Store sensitive configuration in environment variables:
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Firebase API key
- `DEFAULT_EMERGENCY_CONTACT`: Default emergency contact number

## Security Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Authentication Tests**
   - Password strength validation
   - Rate limiting enforcement
   - Invalid input handling

2. **Data Protection Tests**
   - Input sanitization effectiveness
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention

3. **Access Control Tests**
   - User data access restrictions
   - Device ownership verification
   - Unauthorized access attempts

### Security Audit Checklist

- [ ] All passwords are hashed with unique salts
- [ ] No sensitive data stored in plaintext
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Firebase security rules properly configured
- [ ] Emergency alert system functioning
- [ ] Data encryption in transit and at rest

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Immediately lock account and notify user
2. **Data Breach**: Assess scope, notify affected users, strengthen security
3. **Suspicious Activity**: Investigate and implement additional monitoring

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Response**: Contain the incident and assess impact
2. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and scope
3. **Notification**: Inform affected users and authorities if required
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations with enhanced security
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures based on findings

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: User consent and data minimization
- **Data Retention**: Automatic deletion of old data
- **User Rights**: Data export and deletion capabilities

### Security Standards
